# (TODO)
An optimistic outlook

- Complete ELF parser (for mapping sections)
- Create project structure (gonna extract sections from ELF files to make them easier to work with; JSON style config perhaps also)
- Port and abstract minimal PoC shown in README.md ()
- Create Higherlighters w/ Qt (this may involve creating many custom components to attempt to handle selection synchronisation; perhaps a new Qt project will be created in the same project, under a different branch)
- Attempt to create graphs by building up control flowish models during the disassembly
- Implement common binutils tools such as ./strings (so that MalwareTech feels comfortable using it).
